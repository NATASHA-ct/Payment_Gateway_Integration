# Payment_Gateway_Integration
In this project I integrate the payment gateway STRIPE to a product page using Django.

## What you need
- Stripe account
- On your account switch to test mode
- Get your API stripe public key and your secret key
- Make sure to keep your keys in an env , thats best practise for security purposes.

## Stripe documentation used:
### for payment and checkout integration
- https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart

### for webhook integration
- https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks


## Screenshot
The card details below are provided by stripe and are for testing, anyone can use them
